# Studor - A Study Session / Tutor Finding Site
Studor is a website developed to help students at Texas A&M University find tutors or upcoming study sessions with students in their classes. Finding tutors or people to study with can be difficult without an established service to do so, and unfortunately Texas A&M does not have a singular setup for this. We hope to help students by providing a platform that helps streamline this process.
